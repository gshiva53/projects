        Hi, I am Shiva Gupta, student in Swinburne university of Technology. I
        have develoepd this project for the sake of learning. The site is built
        using Vue.js, Bootstrap. All the data shown is using the NASA's
        Astronomical Picture of the Day API and Iamge and Video Library.

      <p class="display-6 text-muted">About the Website</p>
      <p>
        This website was developed for the purpose of learning. It explores how
        breathtaking our space really is and how organizations like NASA, ISRO
        can spread more awareness just by exposing the content, be that in the
        form of APIs. For more information about NASA APIs:

      <p>
        One of the most popular websites at NASA is the Astronomy Picture of the
        Day. In fact, this website is one of the most popular websites across
        all federal agencies. It has the popular appeal of a Justin Bieber
        video. This endpoint structures the APOD imagery and associated metadata
        so that it can be repurposed for other applications. In addition, if the
        concept_tags parameter is set to True, then keywords derived from the
        image explanation are returned. These keywords could be used as
        auto-generated hashtags for twitter or instagram feeds; but generally
        help with discoverability of relevant imagery. The full documentation
        for this API can be found in the APOD API Github repository.

      <p class="display-6 text-muted">About Image and Video Library</p>
      <p>
        Use this API to access the NASA Image and Video Library site at
        images.nasa.gov. For the latest documentation, please go here. The
        images.nasa.gov API is organized around REST, has
        predictable/resource­-oriented URLs and uses HTTP response codes to
        indicate API errors. This API uses built-­in HTTP features such as HTTP
        authentication and HTTP verbs, which are understood by many
        off-­the-­shelf HTTP clients. Please note that JSON is returned by all
        API responses, including errors. Each of the endpoints described below
        also contains example snippets which use the curl command­-line tool,
        Unix pipelines, and the python command­-line tool to output API
        responses in an easy­ to ­read format.
