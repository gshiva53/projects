                I love brainstorming ideas on paper and writing code to make those ideas happen. 
                If I have to deep-dive into technologies then it’s an added bonus.

                I have enjoyed working across many diverse teams with a focus on customer service.
                And I grasp new concepts quickly by reading documentation, often, with minimal training. 
                With a strong foundation in Computer Science and hunger for continuous learning, 
                I am committed to leveraging my technical skills to solve complex problems.

                My specialties include problem solving, analysing requirements, 
                writing testable code, unit testing and documentation. 
                I have a keen interest in software design patterns and system design.
                I’m still enthusiastically grabbing onto any programming languages, frameworks, or principles 
                I can integrate into the coding web in my head.
